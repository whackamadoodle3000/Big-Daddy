Here is a summary of your child's recent computer activity.

**Activity Summary**

During this session, your child switched between educational content, distracting videos, and searches for inappropriate topics.

The session began with a search for "tinder" on YouTube. Your child then spent a few minutes on the educational website Khan Academy before searching for "tinder" again on Google and "violence" on YouTube.

Following these searches, they watched a distracting YouTube video for about three minutes before clicking on another video categorized as inappropriate. The session ended with a long, focused period of over ten minutes on Khan Academy.

**Emotional Observations**

There is a noticeable trend of increased sadness connected to viewing or searching for inappropriate and distracting content. The highest level of sadness was recorded immediately after they visited an inappropriate YouTube link. This may suggest that the content they are seeking out is confusing or upsetting to them. Even during time spent on distracting videos, their sadness levels gradually increased.

**Suggestions for You**

1.  **Start a Conversation About Tough Topics:** Your child searched for "tinder" and "violence." This is a good opportunity to have an open, non-judgmental conversation about their curiosity. You could start by saying, "We want to make sure you're safe online. Sometimes we all get curious about new things. If you have questions about relationships or see something scary, please know you can always come to us."

2.  **Check In On Their Feelings:** The data suggests a link between certain online content and feelings of sadness. It might be helpful to ask how they are feeling in general and if anything they've seen online has ever made them feel sad, scared, or confused. This reinforces that you are a safe person to talk to.

3.  **Acknowledge the Positive:** Your child spent a significant amount of focused time on Khan Academy. Praising this effort can be very encouraging. Acknowledging their hard work shows that you see their positive choices, not just the concerning ones.
