**Summary of Computer Activity for Parents**

**Date of Activity:** June 21, 2025
**Time of Activity (UTC):** 16:37 - 16:48

This report provides a brief, 11-minute snapshot of your child's recent computer activity. The goal is to offer insight and support you in guiding their digital journey.

**Overview of Activity**

During this session, your child moved between three distinct types of content: educational material, distracting videos, and searches for inappropriate or mature topics.

1.  **Inappropriate Content (Requires Attention):**
    The most significant concern from this session involves searches for topics not appropriate for your child's age.
    *   There were two searches for "tinder" (a dating app for adults), one on Google and one on YouTube.
    *   There was a search on YouTube for "violence."
    *   Near the end of the session, your child clicked on a YouTube video flagged as inappropriate.

2.  **Educational Activity (Positive):**
    Your child spent several minutes on Khan Academy, an educational website. This is positive and shows an effort to engage with learning materials. We should encourage this type of use.

3.  **Distracting Content (Common Behavior):**
    A notable amount of time was also spent watching a non-educational YouTube video. While not inappropriate, this type of activity can be distracting from schoolwork or other responsibilities.

**Emotional Trends and Concerns**

Our system monitors for emotional indicators based on user interaction. While "neutral" was the primary detected emotion, there was a noticeable and steady increase in "sadness" throughout the session.

*   This feeling of sadness appeared to increase during the longer periods of activity, both on the educational site (which could indicate boredom or frustration) and the distracting YouTube video.
*   Crucially, the highest levels of sadness were detected immediately following the searches for "violence" and after viewing the inappropriate video. This suggests that exposure to this content may be causing distress, confusion, or other difficult feelings.

**Suggestions for You**

It's common for children to be curious, but how we guide that curiosity is key. Here are a few simple, actionable suggestions based on this activity:

1.  **Open a Gentle Conversation about Tough Topics.** The searches for "tinder" and "violence" are an opportunity. In a calm moment, you could ask non-judgmentally, "Sometimes kids hear about things online, like dating apps or scary videos. Have you ever seen anything that made you feel weird or sad? I'm always here to talk about it, and you'll never be in trouble for asking." This opens the door for them to share what they're curious or worried about.

2.  **Acknowledge and Encourage the Positive.** Praise their effort on Khan Academy. You could ask what they're learning or if they're finding any subjects difficult. The sadness detected during this time might signal they need help or are feeling overwhelmed by the material. Checking in shows you value their hard work.

3.  **Discuss Digital Choices.** Talk about the internet as a place with different "rooms." Some rooms are for learning (like Khan Academy), some are for fun (like gaming videos), and some are for adults only. This helps them build a mental framework for making safer choices online without making specific content forbidden and more tempting.

This summary is a tool to help you understand and connect. Your guidance and open communication are the most effective tools for keeping your child safe and resilient online.
