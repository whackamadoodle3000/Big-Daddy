**Summary of Recent Computer Activity**
**Date:** June 21, 2025
**Time Period:** 16:37 - 16:48 UTC

This report summarizes your child's recent computer activity. It is intended to help you understand their online experience and provide a starting point for supportive conversations.

**Overview of Activity**

During this brief 11-minute period, your child switched between educational material, distracting content, and searches for inappropriate topics.

*   **Educational Content:** Your child spent several minutes on the educational website Khan Academy. They appeared to be engaged with the material for a continuous block of time, which is a positive sign of focus on their schoolwork.

*   **Inappropriate Searches:** There were several searches for mature and concerning topics. These included:
    *   Two searches for the dating app "Tinder" (on both YouTube and Google).
    *   One search for "violence" on YouTube.
    *   A visit to a specific YouTube video that was flagged as inappropriate.

*   **Distracting Content:** Towards the end of the session, your child spent over two and a half minutes watching a single YouTube video categorized as distracting.

It is worth noting the pattern of activity. Your child frequently switched from an inappropriate search directly to the Khan Academy website. This may indicate an awareness that they are viewing restricted content.

**Emotional Observations**

A primary concern from this session is a consistent and significant increase in emotions indicating sadness.

*   The session started with neutral emotions.
*   While working on Khan Academy, feelings of sadness began to rise steadily. This could suggest that your child is feeling frustrated, overwhelmed, or stressed by their schoolwork.
*   The feelings of sadness peaked at the end of the session, immediately after viewing the video flagged as inappropriate and then clicking back to Khan Academy.

This emotional trend suggests that the online experience, whether related to schoolwork or exploring difficult topics, may be causing your child distress.

**Suggestions for You**

This data points to a need for a gentle and open conversation. The goal is not to punish, but to understand what is driving their curiosity and how they are feeling.

1.  **Talk About the Searches:** Find a calm moment to start a non-judgmental conversation about online safety. You could ask generally if they've seen things online that have made them curious or confused. The searches for "Tinder" and "violence" are an opportunity to understand what they are curious about, correct any misinformation, and discuss your family's values and safety rules.

2.  **Check In on Schoolwork:** The sadness detected during the Khan Academy session is a key finding. Ask them how they are feeling about their schoolwork. They may be struggling with a specific subject, feeling pressure, or simply be frustrated. Offering help or adjusting expectations could provide significant relief.

3.  **Address the Sadness:** Let them know you are there for them. You could say something like, "I've noticed you seem a bit down lately, and I want you to know you can talk to me about anything that's bothering you." The combination of sad feelings and searches for mature content suggests they may be trying to process difficult emotions.

4.  **Reinforce That You're a Safe Harbor:** Remind them that they can always come to you with questions or concerns about anything they encounter online, without fear of getting in trouble. Creating this trust is the most effective way to ensure their long-term safety.
